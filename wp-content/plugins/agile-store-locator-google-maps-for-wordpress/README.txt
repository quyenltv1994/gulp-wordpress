FAQ:
When encounter these errors:
The uploaded file exceeds the upload_max_filesize directive in php.ini.

Update your PHP.ini

------------------------------------------
The most basic error is because of multiple time inclusion of google maps, so if you facing such issue simply remove line number 102

press "CTRL + U" from browser and search for the path below, if its added multiple times then you have multiple inclusion of map.
